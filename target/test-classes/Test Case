ctions and guidance telling me what programs I need to install on my PC to run the automation and also instructions on how to run the automation, and

(c) A trial run demonstrating that BS provides screen recordings of each run and logs (information I can forward to my website developer).

The process flow the script is to automate in BS is:

i. Select Device and Browser from Excel sheet (attached)

ii. load website home page: https://catevolution.com.au

iii. scroll top to bottom and back to top of page (has to be slow enough to see whole page (estimate 5-10 seconds)

iv. from menu select product page: https://catevolution.com.au/litter-robot-3-connect.html
scroll top to bottom and back to top of page (5-10 seconds)

v. select grey

vii. select buy now

viii. checkout, fill in delivery address (test information will be provided)

ix. select payment method (credit card or debit card)

x. select Google ads in How did you hear about us

xi. select I have read and agree to the Terms and Conditions

xii. confirm order (this will bring up payment method)

xiii. At this point exit out of checkout (i.e. do not enter any payment details)

xiv. End

xv. Next device and browser combination

Is this something you can do, and if so what is your expected budget.
